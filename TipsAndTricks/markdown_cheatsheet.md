## How to Format Code in Markdown
Code Blocks
To write longer or more detailed snippets of code, it is often better to place them inside a code block. Code blocks allow you to use multiple lines, and markdown will render it inside its own box and with code type font.
To achieve this, start your block with a line of three backticks. This signals to markdown that you are creating a code block. You will need to finish with another line of three backticks. For example:

```js
var add2 = function(number) {
  return number + 2;
}
```
